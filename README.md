# drawing_plots
This project is about drawing a plot with java. The plot displays the statistics of git commits for the current project folder.
The jar folder works by pasting it into your project and executing it there. Then a graph should show up displaying your statistics.
If you have problems with the jar or other parts of this project feel free to leave a comment in the issues section.
